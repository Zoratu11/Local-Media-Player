# Local-Media-Player
Plays songs from a local folder on your computer!

To use it all you have to do it git pull and then open the index.html file.
For it to work properly though you have to have a folder with only mp3 files in it,
you can use the music file here for that or use your own folder.

Also there is a live one at: something.com
